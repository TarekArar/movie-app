- used React native to build cross platform app using javascript
- used expo to do quick setup and allow testers to see the published app from expo scanning qr code
- used react context to handle auth since we have small global state, in case of large apps I would use redux-toolkit
- used React-query to make requests in order to handle caching out of the box
- used debouncing while user searching to improve performance

- Styles to be improved
- API dont have limit params to limit number of fetched items per page
